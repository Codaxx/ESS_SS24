Embedded Systems and Security â€“ Homework Repository

This repository contains the code for the Embedded Systems and Security course at TUM.

During this course, students explore various security vulnerabilities in embedded systems. The primary objective is to apply techniques such as stack overflow attacks to exploit an Infineon XMC4500 Relax Lite Kit microcontroller and execute specific commands on the device.

This repository serves as a reference for implementing and understanding embedded security concepts in a hands-on environment.
